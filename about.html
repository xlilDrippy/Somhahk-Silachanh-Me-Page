<!--ABOUT PARAGRAPH-->
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
        <p>
            I am 24 years old. I gradated the University of New Mexico with a
            bacherlors in Fine Arts. My major is in Interdispicanary Film and
            Digital Media with a minor in Animations. I enjoy working on indie
            films, student films, and film festivals. I'm currently working in
            television. My credits include Big Sky Season 2, Big Sky Season 3, and a
            pilot episode for Criminal Nature. Reason's I'm taking classes at
            SheCodes are many. I want to expand my skill sets as a person. I think
            coding is so interesting. I think to the average person coding is an
            impossible and complex task. I've always been up for the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm learning how to code so I can hone my craft to join a department
            called Video Play Back. In film, the job intales that any time you see a
            screen, or phone, or tablet, in film it's basically a video playing back
            at the camera. Coding can help me code "fake" apps so when an actor uses
            a phone it's an app I made to make it look like the real thing, but it's
            not. When you see an actor on facebook or texting, they aren't using the
            real app. It's a fake app to look like the real thing but made more
            actor friendly. User error can make them press a "like" button on
            accident, misspell a text. Me coding the "fake" app can cancel out that
            error. Plus if film doesn't work out for me, I always have programing as
            a back-up career.
